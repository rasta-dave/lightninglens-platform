This project provides the simulation environment for the [Lightning Lens](https://github.com/rasta-dave/lightning-lens) AI analysis tool.

## Project Ecosystem

This repository contains the Lightning Network simulation environment. For the complete system:

- **Current Repository**: Provides the Lightning Network simulation environment with Docker-based nodes and realistic payment patterns.
- **[Lightning Lens](https://github.com/rasta-dave/lightning-lens)**: The companion repository that contains the machine learning model that analyzes data from this simulation and provides rebalancing recommendations.

Both repositories are designed to work together to create a complete Lightning Network optimization system.

## Overview

Lightning Network Simulation is a comprehensive testing environment that creates a realistic Lightning Network with multiple nodes, channels, and payment patterns. It generates transaction data that can be used to train machine learning models for optimizing channel liquidity and improving payment success rates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- jq (for JSON processing)
- Python 3.6+ (for simulation scripts)

## Real-Time ML Integration

The Lightning Network simulation supports real-time integration with machine learning models through a WebSocket server.

### Setup

1. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install websockets requests flask
   ```

2. Start the WebSocket server:

   ```bash
   python scripts/websocket_server.py
   ```

3. Run the simulation with ML integration:

   ```bash
   python scripts/simulate_network.py
   ```

4. Connect your ML model to receive real-time updates and provide rebalancing suggestions.

### How It Works

- The WebSocket server provides a real-time data stream of channel states and transactions
- ML models can connect to `ws://localhost:6789` to receive updates
- Models can send rebalancing suggestions back through the same connection
- The simulation will check for and apply ML-suggested rebalancing operations

### Data Format

The WebSocket server sends JSON messages with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "transaction",
  "data": {
    "sender": "lnd-alice",
    "receiver": "lnd-bob",
    "amount": 1000,
    "success": true,
    "description": "Coffee purchase"
  }
}
```

For channel updates:

```json
{
  "type": "channel_update",
  "data": {
    "lnd-alice": [
      {
        "remote_pubkey": "02b115e8f3...",
        "capacity": 1000000,
        "local_balance": 590000,
        "remote_balance": 406530
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

ML models can send rebalancing suggestions in this format:

```json
{
  "type": "rebalance_suggestion",
  "suggestion": {
    "from_node": "lnd-alice",
    "to_node": "lnd-bob",
    "amount": 200000,
    "confidence": 0.85
  }
}
```

### Setup

1. Start the network:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Initialize the network:

```bash
sudo ./setup-nodes.sh
```

3. If needed, unlock the wallets:

```bash
sudo ./unlock-wallets.sh
```

### Complete Workflow with Lightning Lens

To run the complete system with Lightning Lens:

```bash
# ======= Inside of the Lightning Network Simulation directory =======

# 1. Start the WebSocket server (simulation side)
python scripts/websocket_server.py

# ======= Inside of the LightningLens directory =======

# 2. Start the HTTP server (receives data, serves predictions)
python scripts/http_server.py

# 3. Start the WebSocket client (connects to simulation)
python scripts/websocket_client.py

# 4. Start the adapter proxy (transforms data between systems)
python scripts/adapter_proxy.py

# ======= Inside of the Lightning Network Simulation directory =======
# 5. Start the simulation
python scripts/simulate_network.py
```

Let the simulation run for at least 10 minutes to collect sufficient data. The components work together:

1. The **simulation** generates Lightning Network transactions and channel states
2. The **WebSocket server** broadcasts this data
3. The **WebSocket client** receives the data from the simulation
4. The **adapter proxy** transforms the data into the format needed by the model
5. The **HTTP server** stores the data and will later serve predictions

## Using the Simulation

### Channel Rebalancing

The `rebalance-channels.sh` script is provided as a utility for:

- **Initial setup**: Creating a baseline balanced state before starting experiments
- **Development testing**: Quickly fixing severely imbalanced channels during development
- **Benchmark comparison**: Providing a reference point for comparing ML-based rebalancing strategies

```bash
sudo ./scripts/rebalance-channels.sh
```

**Note for ML model development**: If you're developing an ML model to optimize channel liquidity, you may want to:

1. Use this script only for initial setup or between experiments
2. Modify the simulation script to disable automatic rebalancing
3. Let your ML model observe natural imbalances and propose its own rebalancing strategies

### Network Simulation

Run the simulation script to generate realistic payment patterns:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/simulate_network.py
```

The simulation will:

- Create random payments between nodes
- Log transaction data to a CSV file
- Display real-time statistics
- Periodically rebalance channels (can be disabled for ML model development)

#### For ML Model Development

If you're developing an ML model to optimize channel liquidity:

1. Edit `scripts/simulate_network.py` and set `REBALANCE_FREQUENCY = 0` to disable automatic rebalancing
2. Let your ML model observe the channel states as they evolve naturally
3. Have your model propose rebalancing actions based on its learning
4. Compare your model's performance against the baseline rebalancing script

### Cleanup and Reset

To reset the network:

```bash
sudo ./cleanup.sh
```

This script will:

1. Stop all Docker containers
2. Remove all data directories (bitcoin-data, lnd-\*-data)
3. Reset all channel states and balances
4. Optionally back up your simulation data

**Note:** Running this script will delete all channel information and wallet data. Make sure to save any important simulation results before running it.

After cleanup, you'll need to run the setup process again:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
sudo ./setup-nodes.sh
```

## Network Structure

```
Alice ---- Bob ---- Carol
  |         |         |
  |         |         |
 Eve ------ | ----- Dave
```

Each node has channels with its neighbors, allowing for multi-hop payments across the network.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your Lightning Network testnet:

1. **Check node status**:

   ```bash
   docker exec lnd-alice lncli --network=regtest getinfo
   ```

2. **View logs for errors**:

   ```bash
   docker logs lnd-alice
   ```

3. **Restart specific nodes**:

   ```bash
   docker restart lnd-alice
   ```

4. **If all else fails**, use the cleanup script and set up again:
   ```bash
   sudo ./cleanup.sh
   docker-compose up -d
   sudo ./setup-nodes.sh
   ```
